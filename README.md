## Reflection

  - As a post pandemic grocery shopper 
I want to be able to log in and access the search bar to search for grocery stores
So that I can find the nearest one in my area and make a reservation to shop without the hassle of a wait line.


  - What did you set out to build?
  - Why was this project challenging and therefore a really good learning experience?
  - What were some unexpected obstacles?
  - What tools did you use to implement this project?
      - This might seem obvious because you are IN this codebase, but to all other humans now is the time to talk about why you chose webpack instead of create react app, or D3, or vanilla JS instead of a framework etc. Brag about your choices and justify them here.
